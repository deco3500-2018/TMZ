                <p>My strengths and professional ethos has always been based around hard work and determination. Being honest, realistic and reliable with all personal and professional aspects has allowed me to build relationships and networks to channel my opportunities for progression and contribute to a solutions-focused team.</p>
                <p>Throughout my experiences in university, I’ve developed many skills in terms of design knowledge and programming. From all my experiences in my degree, I’ve found my strengths to be through the technical side and the back-end related programming. For this course, I wish to work on more of my weaknesses, that being the different design aspects and possibly any further chances to pitch and present an idea.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Currently studying B Multimedia Design in my third year, my strengths and weaknesses is the graphic design and UI/UX related design work. Confident with front-end programming but not back-end so will assist in any front-end related programming work and only simple back-end. I have experiences the past 3 years in HTML/CSS coding developing mainly front end for assignments and clients.</p>
                <p>Areas im poor at is i have trouble vouching my ideas within a group, like either it’s the inability to express my ideas to the group which causes me to have a lack of creativity on the spot, until a couple of couple days later then a good idea will pop up. </p>

                </div>
                <p>My aspirations for this course are to understand the ways technology affect our daily lives and participate in the discourse of the ever changing environment of technology and the design space, all the while improving my own personal design and development skills. Design skills include the understanding of the design process, with the ability to analyse user research for iteration purposes and later document them in an understandable manner. While these strengths are aspects that I wish to improve on further in this course, my weaknesses lie within programming and the general issue of time management.</p>

                <p class="mt-md-5 mb-3 mt-3">From studying in digital media and previous semester, I consider myself able to build the prototype by implementing the project concept and based on the evaluation of the needs of target audience. Then, to develop a strategic task to test the prototype, collect and integrate the user feedback by observing, questionnaire and interviewing to generate the specific area and function that need to improve from a professional perspective. Moreover, I will keep refining the prototype by addressing HCI concept, and use the design thinking process to implement the project by iterating the concept from new data and findings. Then, based on project requirements to provide precise suggestions to the front-end and back-end programmer, to deliver a better user experience in the final installation. My weakness is that I don't have much experience with language programming, I can only build a basic website by HTML/CSS.</p>
