# TMZ

## Team
Team TMZ have grown comfortable with each other, allowing for any idea to be shared with no fear of being denied the right to express opinions or ideas. While all members have varying levels of strength in the design process, the team are able to rely on other members to assist them to achieve efficient problem solving, all the while achieving the personal goals set by each individual. It is a strength in itself that our team are able to depend on each other, improving the overall quality of work.

### David Tran
As I am majoring in Software Design, my main job would be to work with user-experience developers and graphic designers of the group in developing and creating our final project. My duties for the project will be to ensure and complete core functionalities that are required to satisfy our task and also help group members develop their back-end programming skills. I will be utilising my knowledge with HTML/CSS/JavaScript/SQL throughout each prototype when creating features relevant to our problem space.

### Hamish Tran

My duties as a designer is to contribute with the works that affects the front using HTML/CSS that contributes to the frontend and gathering data from local businesses and user research on what our audience values & beliefs are. 

### Rong Nemo Zhang
As a user experience designer, I will work alongside the design process by contributing to the facets involving graphic design, documentation and assist in the development of the product. Certain duties that I will be involved in is the prototyping of design, use of HTML/CSS for the final outcome and working with target users in order to justify or change the design decisions made by the team. 

### Momoka Matsubara - Park
In this project, I consider myself good at building the prototype based on the analysis from the target user. To get closer to the user experience of the prototype, I had the previous experience with setting questions and test plan that could expand more details from the testing result. During the project development, I will cooperate with the team, and take over my tasks on high responsibility, and complete the work on time with a high level of quality.
